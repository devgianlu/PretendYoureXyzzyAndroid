<b>Collaborative decks</b>
You can now create custom decks with your friends! Just add your friend in Overloaded (must be mutual friendship), star his deck and ask him to make you a collaborator of that deck.
Collaborators can view the private deck they are collaborating to, add, edit and remove cards.

This feature is available for Overloaded users only.


<b>Custom decks images</b>
Add images to your custom decks (as white cards only) with a link, Overloaded users can upload images directly from their devices.
